#Crystal Collector
This is a first approach to completing the Crystal Collectors game with an attempt at recreating the flair of a middle eastern market. In Istanbul, the Grand Bazaar was a glorious place of colors, smells, bargains, and haggling. I hope you enjoy the game which is built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play

In this game, you are trying to get the correct number of gems <b>without</b> going over. Each
crystal has a hidden value that will increase your total number of points. If you are able to get to
the total without going over, you will be the winner.
